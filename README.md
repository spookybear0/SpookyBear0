# Hello, I'm spookybear0.

## About me

I'm a self-taught programmer who is passionate about backend (and sometimes frontend) web development, game development/modding, and electronics. I started programming when I was 12 and haven't stopped since. Whenever I encounter a challenge, I dedicate my time to solving it, whether that means debugging for hours or picking up a completely new language or framework.
